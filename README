Apportionment.py

Calculates Congressional apportionment based on census data in the same method the US Census uses. 

I have included both the 2010 and 2020 population data published by the Census.

You can edit the MaxReps variable to see what the map would look like with more
or less representatives than the current 435. You can edit the data files to see
how apportionment changes with population changes. You can add territories like
PR or DC to see how the map would change if they had representation.
